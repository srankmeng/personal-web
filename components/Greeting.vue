      Hello & Welcome to my website
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-xl my-4" style="text-indent: 32px">
      I am a team lead & web developer who wants to improve my skill always. I
      have several experiences with software development. For technical skills
      such as frontend, backend, automated testing, and AWS services (EC2, S3,
      Lambda, Cloudfront, etc.). For other skills, I used to use the Agile
      process in my projects which have planning, backlogs refinement, daily
      stand up, and retrospective. And I can use tools that are related to my
      tasks. In addition, I supported the team like a review code, coaching team
      members and finding the solutions when having some problems for delivering
      tasks on time for team success.

      Currently I am overseas to study English in Brisbane, Australia for 6
      months (August to January from Monday to Friday 8.00 AM - 14.00 PM.) So I
      am looking for a part-time job. Please feel free to contact me, thank you
      all.
