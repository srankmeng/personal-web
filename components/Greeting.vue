      Hello & Welcome to my website
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-xl my-4" style="text-indent: 32px">
      I am a team lead & web developer who wants to improve my skill always. I
      have several experiences with software development. For technical skills
      such as frontend, backend, automated testing, and AWS services (EC2, S3,
      Lambda, Cloudfront, etc.). I'm good on the frontend more than the backend
      but I can do it as well. For other skills, I used to use the Agile process
      in my projects which have planning, backlogs refinement, daily stand-up,
      and retrospective. And I can use tools that are related to my tasks. In
      addition, I supported the team like a review code, coaching team members,
      and finding solutions when having some problems with delivering tasks on
      time for team success.

      I am overseas to study English in Brisbane, Australia for 6 months (August
      to January from Monday to Friday 8.00 AM - 14.00 PM.) So I am looking for
      a part-time job after the classes. Please feel free to contact me, thank
      you all.
