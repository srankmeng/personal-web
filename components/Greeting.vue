      I have experience with 10+ years of Web development. For technical skills
      such as frontend, backend, automated testing, devOps, and AWS services (EC2,
      ECS, S3, Lambda, etc.). I used to use the Agile process in my projects which
      have planning, backlog refinement, daily stand up, and retrospective. And I can
      use tools that are related to my tasks. In addition, I supported the team like a
      review the code, coaching team members, and finding solutions when having
      problems delivering tasks on time for team success.
